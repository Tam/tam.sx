<p>"Hurry, quickly!" She said, as she watched her husband pack the last of their essentials into his rucksack. She glanced down; first to her daughter in the carrier clasped to her chest, and then at the phone held tightly in her hand. The message notification telling them to evacuate was still visible on her lock screen. A cacophony of panicked voices, of shouts, screams, and cries, drifted in through the open window of their small apartment from the street below.<br>
"Okay," he said as he forced the bag shut, a tin can poking out slightly from the top, "that's everything."</p>
<p>They took one last look around their flat, searching for anything that might have been forgotten. It looked as though someone had ransacked their home; drawers emptied onto tables, furniture pushed carelessly aside. They couldn't afford to be tidy.</p>
<p>Their infant daughter let out a moan, her arms reached up to her mothers face. Her mother kissed her on the forehead then adjusted the carrier on her chest.</p>
<p>"Okay?" She asked, as she looked anxiously at her husband. He nodded solemnly. With a deep breath they turned and hurriedly left their home, grim in the knowledge that they would likely never return.</p>
<p>As they headed down the stairs they passed the wide open doors of their neighbours apartments, all similarly abandoned. In one, a child's toys lay scattered across the floor. In another an old black and white film was playing on a decidedly modern TV. One looked as though it had never been lived in, though they were sure it had been occupied mere days before.</p>
<p>A dog whimpered as they passed the open door of an apartment on the first floor. The animal tugged at the lead around its neck, straining with all its might, trying desperately to make its own escape. But the leash, tied to a radiator pipe, refused to give. They could see a bag of dog food spilling out on to the floor behind the forsaken animal, as well as a few bowls of water full to overflowing. Barely enough to last a week. The paws and haunches of the dog, as well as the ground around it, were wet. The smell was strong, even in the corridor.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sonic boom of a jet blasted overhead as they stepped out onto the crowded city street. Their daughter started crying.<br>
"Shhhhh, shhh, it's okay". Her mother wrapped an arm around her and gently rocked her up and down. The mother grabbed her husbands hand with her free hand and clasped it tightly. Together they forced their way into the throng and, working against the flow of the fleeing crowd, made their way down the street.</p>
<p>The road was jammed with cars; everyone trying to escape the city as fast as possible. Honking, yelling, screaming, crying. Most had already abandoned their vehicles, having come to the conclusion that their evacuation would be faster on foot.</p>
<p>A few of the shop windows had been smashed, but not many. It seemed that most people were too worried about fleeing their homes which, as they had discovered all at once, had just become part of a very large target. Looting now seemed pointless. In one of the unbroken windows hung an advertisement that read, "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Buy Iodine tablets now!".</p>
<p>Slowly the couple and their daughter pushed their way through the flow of people trying to leave the city. Suddenly there were screams, thuds, then bodies tumbling towards them. A car rammed through the crowd. He jumped aside trying to pull his wife out of the way of the oncoming vehicle and into the protection of a nearby doorway, but her hand was wrenched from his. Amongst the shouting and cries, gunshots rang out. Then a screech and a bang.</p>
<p>"Lucy!" He yelled, frantically looking around for his wife and daughter. "LUCY!"<br>
"Here! Oscar!" Lucy cried. She was hiding, ducked between two stationary cars on the other side of the wide pavement. Oscar hurried over to her, stumbling over those not lucky enough to have gotten out of the way in time. He threw an arm around Lucy and could feel her shaking. At the same time he cupped the back of his crying daughters head.<br>
"Are you okay? Ella?" He asked, his face pressed against hers.<br>
"Yes, we're fine. We're both fine." Lucy answered, her voice trembling. Some soldiers tried to tend to the wounded but the crowd was already growing around them, flooding the newly opened space like a tsunami, panic surging them forward relentlessly with little regard for the injured or dead.</p>
<p>Oscar helped Lucy to her feet and, with an effort, they carried on along the pavement. Finally they reached a deserted alley into which they ducked, out of the throng.<br>
"Nearly there, sweetie" Lucy said, in an attempt to reassure both herself and her daughter.</p>
<p>As they made their way through the alleyway they passed a homeless man; thin, stubbled, cast aside and forgotten, seemingly asleep in a weathered sleeping bag. Next to his motionless hand lay an empty can of pain thinner.</p>
<p>The alleyway opened out onto another packed road, beyond which flowed a large river.<br>
"Come on" Oscar said, and, with his arm tightly around Lucy's shoulders, they forced their way through the crowd and out onto the far side of the road next to the river.</p>
<p>As they reached the other side two more jets zoomed overhead.<br>
"Shit!" Lucy exclaimed, "Where is it?!" The couple looked frantically up and down the river.<br>
"There!" Cried Oscar, pointing a little way up stream at a small boat. The vessel was adrift, buffeting between the bank and a cluster of wooden poles sticking out of the river bed; remnants from some long forgotten structure. Relieved that the boat was still there, and within reach, they hurriedly made their way towards it.</p>
<p>As they neared the boat an explosion rang out a short way down the river behind them, which was quickly followed by screams and gunfire. Panic spread through the evacuees like a shockwave and everyone started running, surged on by those behind them. A fleeing woman tripped and fell to the ground with a dull thud. Her young son tried to help her to her feet; screaming, crying. But the stampede continued indifferently. The boy was forced to the edge of the crowd, his nose running, tears rolling down his cheeks, arms clasped tightly together. He mouthed the word 'Mummy' as he stared, trembling, at the motionless body, lying face down in a pool of crimson blood that was spreading slowly from its head.</p>
<p>Lucy and Oscar pushed on. Upon reaching the boat Oscar clambered over the river wall and, hanging over the water, reached out with his foot to pull the boat flush against the side. The current was fast and doing so took considerable effort. That done, still hanging from the wall, he carefully helped Lucy, with Ella still strapped to her chest, over the side and down onto the boat.</p>
<p>Once aboard they found, to their dismay, that the boat had been ransacked. The dashboard had been forced open, frayed wires protruding from the hole. The under-seat storage on the open aft of the boat had been opened and emptied. Some straps and bits of rope were all that remained, scattered across the deck. The wooden cover that blocked the entrance to the cabin below deck had big scratches and gashes in it, but was otherwise intact. Clearly, whoever it was that had pillaged the boat gave up and abandoned ship when they were unable to make headway into the cabin.</p>
<p>Oscar unlocked and opened the cabin, then turned to Lucy.<br>
"Get Ella below" he said, "I'll push us off. We can at least drift down river while we try and get the engine started."<br>
"Okay" Lucy agreed and headed below deck.<br>
"And see if you can find the rudder" he called after her.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, Oscar set about casting off. He shoved the small boat away from the bank and out into the river.</p>
<p>"I've got the rudder" said Lucy, having returned from the cabin. "Ella's in the little room." She added as she handed the rudder to Oscar.<br>
"Good" he said, taking the rudder and slotting it into place at the back of the boat.</p>
<p>Lucy promptly set to work repairing the damage done to the dashboard while Oscar steered them out into the centre of the river. She reconnected the frayed cables, twisting the copper wires back together before sealing them with electrical tape. Then she reconnected some small plugs which had been pulled out of the front panel. Once that was done she closed up the forced hatch, sealing it shut with more tape.<br>
"Keys!" She said, turning to Oscar. Oscar searched around in his pockets for a moment before finding them and tossing them to Lucy. Lucy caught the keys, stuck one in the keyhole, and turned. Lights flickered on. Lucy and Oscar held their breaths as Lucy pressed the start button for the motor. It coughed for a second and then sputtered into life. Oscar removed the rudder and they started speeding down the river.</p>
<p>They passed crowded ferries, filled to bursting with terrified faces. They passed police boats, their sirens blearing. The phrase 'Please evacuate calmly. Leave all personal belongings, take only food and water' echoed out on repeat from large loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Some of the more desperate evacuees had started jumping from the crowded banks into the river and were swimming down stream.</p>
<p>Boats filled with heavily armed, black-clad people sped passed them, heading up river towards the sound of gunfire. Four more jets blasted overhead, explosions could be heard going off around the city. Oscar, Lucy, and Ella continued down the river.</p>
<p>Buildings slowly gave way to trees and bushes, as the family wound their way through the outskirts and exited the city. Three explosions rang out in the distant countryside, followed by three trails of white smoke that streaked up into the sky. The missiles rocketed overhead, roaring louder than thunder. Ella started to cry.<br>
"I'll go" said Oscar and he headed down into the cabin as Lucy continued to steer the boat. Ella was in a little storage room off of the cramped corridor that ran between the tiny kitchen and living area at the entrance of the cabin and the equally small bedroom at the bow. As Oscar approached the room a brilliant flash lit up the sky. Oscar turned to look back out of the cabins entrance. The sound of a huge explosion hit the boat.<br>
"LUCY!" Oscar cried in anguish as the scolding shockwave sent him flying backwards. The air itself seemed to catch fire. The force of the blast slammed the sliding door to the little room shut. Ella let out a cry.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>A girl, no older than seven, was toying with a rubber duck in a bath. Flecks of paint had fallen away from the sides of the tub, revealing the rusted metal below. The state of the bath well reflected the state of the room. The dull wallpaper was peeling off in sheets, exposing the dirty wall behind. Layers of dust and grime coated the toiletries beside the sink. An electric shaver, batteries long since dead. A pair of toothbrushes and a half emptied tube of toothpaste. It was as though whomever lived there simply up and vanished many years ago. There came a knock at the door.<br>
"Ella, come on, it's been five minutes." The voice of a man drifted through into the room. It had actually been closer to fifteen minutes, but Ella didn't complain.<br>
"Ugh, fine" She sighed, splashing the rubber duck down into the water, disgruntled.</p>
<p>Having dried and dressed in pyjamas she left the shabby little bathroom, her hair still dripping. She walked down the hallway, pushing a bit of fallen wallpaper to the side with her foot, and then down the set of creaky stairs, whose banister wobbled in a slightly unnerving fashion, and across into the kitchen. Her father was sitting at the kitchen table; gaunt, motionless, with his back to the entrance. Ella walked over to him and sat down. Dim evening light, hues of pink and orange, spilt into the room, highlighting the right side of his face and head which were distorted with burn scars. The scarring continued down his neck, under his shirt, and along his right arm. His eyes were vacant, staring emptily into the distance.</p>
<p>"Dad." Said Ella, as she placed her hand on his. Oscar broke from his reverie and smiled at her gently.<br>
"I was just talking to Saoirse" he said, pushing the broken radio in front of him aside revealing a military looking map below. The map was covered in groups of large, red, concentric circles, with each group centred on the location of a large city. The shapes covered much of the country, some spanning hundreds of miles across.<br>
"Apparently," he continued, "the village not far from here is still relatively intact" pointing to a location on the map. He put his arm around his daughters shoulders as she leaned into him.<br>
"It might be somewhere we can stay. At least" he added, "for a little while longer than usual."<br>
"Mhumn" Ella yawned in response.<br>
"Your hair is still wet." Said Oscar, "And now so's my shirt!"<br>
"It wouldn't be if someone would fix the hairdryer" Ella replied, emphasising the 'someone'.<br>
"Huh" Oscar chuckled slightly, "I'd be lucky if I could fix a plug." He gazed dejectedly at the broken radio, frayed wires poking out from the open back. "Your mum..." Oscar started, but trailed off.</p>
<p>After a moment he inhaled sharply.<br>
"Right" he said, "off to bed miss."<br>
"But my hair!"<br>
"You'll survive, come on."</p>
<p>The light from the setting sun was very dim, having fallen below the rolling hills in the distance, and was now only illuminating the wispy clouds in the sky. Oscar picked up a solar charged lantern from the table and turned it on. Together, guided by its faint glow, they walked out of the kitchen, up the creaky stairs with the wobbly banister, across the landing, and into a small bedroom.</p>
<p>Much like the rest of the house, the room and its contents were covered in a thick layer of dust. Barely decipherable, sun bleached posters depicting rockets, planets, and galaxies adorned the walls. Toy cars and a model spaceship rested, undisturbed, on the windowsill. The single bed in the middle of the room had had its dirty, star covered duvet, pillow, and sheets removed and tossed in a corner, replaced with a sleeping bag and rolled up jumper.</p>
<p>Ella slipped into the sleeping bag and did the zip up as far as it would go. She wriggled about a bit trying to get comfortable, before finally resting on her side, her hands by her head. Oscar perched himself on the edge of the bed and picked up a book from a small stack on the nightstand which consisted of various books on myths and legends from antiquity.<br>
"Right" he said, "where were we?" He opened the book up to a dog-eared page. Ella snuggled herself toward him. Oscar started to read.</p>
<p>"Indeed this tyrant himself gave his judgement as to how fortunate he was. For when one of his flatterers, Damoc-"<br>
"Could..." Ella interrupted. She looked away awkwardly for a moment before continuing, "could you tell me about mum?"<br>
Oscar let out a sigh as he looked from his daughter, her face apprehensive, then down to the floor.</p>
<p>"Your mum," he stared, but paused, struggling to find the words. "Your..." another sigh.</p>
<p>"When I was young I... I struggled with... things. There were times when it seemed like a miracle that I managed to make it from one day to the next. I was... drowning." Ella didn't quite understand what that meant, but was sure it wasn't literal.</p>
<p>"Then along comes this girl." Oscar continued. "And she was the most beautiful, and smart... and she could do anything she set her mind to." Ella smiled. "And for some reason I will never understand, she helped me. She kept me going.</p>
<p>"Then, one day, you came along." Oscar smiled as he looked at Ella, cupping the side of her head with his hand, rubbing softly with his thumb. Ella, her eyes closed, gently pushed her head into his palm.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of her in you." He continued. "You're both stubborn" he said, jokingly. Ella screwed up her face in mock annoyance. "You both keep me going."</p>
<p>A moment of silence passed as Oscar continued to stroke Ella's head, Ella, eyes still closed, continued to push her head into his palm.</p>
<p>"Now," Oscar said, bringing his hand back to the book in his lap, "would you like me to keep reading?"</p>
<p>Ella nodded.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sun was still low in the sky when Ella woke, likely no more than an hour or two after daybreak. She jumped out of bed and headed downstairs and into the kitchen. She then proceeded to get a large saucepan and fill it half full with water from a plastic reservoir in the corner of the room. Then she picked up a sealed black plastic bag with a nozzle at one end and a metal loop at the other, and filled it, too, with water. Once that was done she placed the saucepan on the camping stove, which happened to be on top of the old stove in the kitchen, and placed the black bag filled with water into the water in the saucepan.</p>
<p>Having lit the stove, Ella then emptied a can of baked beans into another, smaller, saucepan and placed it on the stove next to its larger brother. She took a moment to gaze out of the window. There were a few trees dotted about the open yard. Some small bushes outlined the fields beyond, overgrown with grasses and weeds, a patchy mixture of greens, yellows, and browns. Off to one side she could see a camper van, and to the other she could see the other farm house. A young woman was wheeling another plastic reservoir towards its front door. Ella climbed onto the edge of the sink, opened the window, and leaned out.<br>
"Morning Saoirse!" She called. Saoirse stopped and looked up.<br>
"Good morning Ella!" She waved and started heading over. She was wearing a flowery summer dress with big walking boots and a yellow box hanging from a chain around her neck. Like Oscar she had burn scars on her skin. Both her forearms, her neck, and a bald patch on her head had visible scarring. A sliver in the middle of one of her arms didn't have any scarring at all, like they had been crossed.<br>
"Your Da still asleep then?"<br>
"Yeah"<br>
"How's he doing?" Saoirse asked caringly.<br>
"He's... fine" Ella answered, unsurely.<br>
Saoirse smiled but her eyes betrayed a melancholy. It was the kind of look that said, 'I don't know what I can do, but I'm here'. Then she glanced over to something in the kitchen.<br>
"I think your beans are burning!" She chuckled.<br>
"Oh!" Ella exclaimed, jumping off the counter and quickly taking the small saucepan off of the stove.<br>
"I'll see you in a bit" called Saoirse as she started heading back toward her house.<br>
"See ya!" Ella called back, pouring the beans onto a plate as she did so.</p>
<p>Having finished off her food and licked the plate clean, Ella turned her attention to the black plastic bag. She turned off the stove and, using a carefully fashioned coat hanger, hooked the bag and lifted it out of the saucepan. Quickly and carefully she carried it up to the bathroom where she hooked the coat hanger over the shower head sticking out of the wall.</p>
<p>Oscar was re-hydrating some powdered milk when Ella beamed into the kitchen having showered and dressed. Oscar's own camping shower was heating up in the same large saucepan.<br>
"Morning sweetie." He said.<br>
"Morning!" Ella hugged him as she went to sit down. "Are we going to visit the new place today?" She asked enthusiastically.<br>
"Yes, Saoirse and John are getting ready if you want to go help?"<br>
Ella jumped up excitedly and headed for the door.<br>
"Ah, wait, don't forget your-" Oscar picked up one of the two yellow boxes attached to chains from the table and shook it at her. Ella jogged back, took it, and carried on running outside while trying to put it on around her neck. Oscar watched her through the window for a moment before turning back to his breakfast. As he did so, he noticed the empty can of beans on the side and gave it a slightly bemused look.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Land Rover zoomed down the small country lane. The road was bordered by overgrown hedges covered in creepers that had crawled their way out across the tarmac. Beyond were unkempt fields overflowing with wild grasses that billowed off into the distance. More overgrown hedgerows, dotted with trees, bordered the fields; segmenting them into large geometric shapes. Weeds had pushed their way though cracks in the road, making little spits of green in a dark grey sea.</p>
<p>Oscar was gazing vacantly out of the window from his passenger seat, while Saoirse and Ella played Rock, Paper, Scissors in the back.<br>
"Ready?" Asked Saoirse.<br>
"One. Two. Three!" The two counted down in unison. Ella held out her hand flat, while Saoirse held out a fist.<br>
"Yay!" Ella laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>John was in the drivers seat. He was an old man, likely in his mid-70s. Unlike Oscar and Saoirse, John didn't have any visible burns. He chuckled along with Ella and Saoirse, occasionally glancing back at them through the rear-view mirror. The Land Rover sped on, headed towards the small country village in the distance.</p>
<p>They slowed down to a crawl as they entered the village. Everyone was alert, watching pensively through the windows. The village was still. If it wasn't for the wind blowing rubbish, dust, and dirt, one could have been mistaken for thinking the village was frozen in time.<br>
"Seems quiet." John observed.</p>
<p>As they drove on the completeness of the villages vacancy became clear, and, slowly, they started to relax. Ella, growing ever braver, stared out of the windows, eyes darting from one thing to the next, taking in as much of her new surroundings as she was able.</p>
<p>They parked up by the statue in the centre of the village square.<br>
"All right" said John once everyone had gotten out, "Saoirse, you and Ella go that way." He pointed down the main street, the largest of the three roads that converged at the statue.<br>
"Oscar, you head that way" he continued, pointing down the second of the three prongs, "I'll go this way. Meet back here in say," he checked his watch, "half an hour. It's a small village, so shouldn't take that long."</p>
<hr>
<p>Ella and Saoirse wandered down the villages main street. They passed dirty shop window after dirty shop window. The displays, obscured by cloudy, unwashed glass, were all coated in thick layers of dust.</p>
<p>They passed a butchers shop. The meat that was once on display had turned to dust, small bones sticking out of the powdery, grey mounds. A barely readable, sun-bleached sign for Banofee Pie hung in the window of the neighbouring bakers where other signs had peeled away, leaving rectangular imprints on the back of the glass.</p>
<p>As they ambled along Ella noticed something behind a shop window on the other side of the street.<br>
"Oh!" She exclaimed as she darted over to the window and pressed her face up against the cloudy glass.<br>
"Can I have it?" She asked once Saoirse had caught up with her. A child size mannequin on the other side of the glass was wearing a denim jacket. The jacket had embroidered butterflies attached to it by their abdomens, making it appear as though they had just landed.<br>
"We're supposed to be looking for important things, like food!" Saoirse said jovially.<br>
"But this IS important!" Cried Ella, "Please can I have it, please!?"<br>
"Okay" sighed Saoirse, "let's find something to break the glass." Ella grinned.</p>
<hr>
<p>John pushed open the front door. In their rush to leave, the previous inhabitants had left it ajar. Dirt, dust, and dead twigs and leaves had been blown in through the gap, forming a shallow mound inside the threshold. John pushed the door open and stepped through into the hallway beyond, taking care to avoid the accumulated dirt. At the end of the hallway he could see a kitchen, while to his left the hall opened out into a cozy looking living room, in spite of the layers of dust and cobwebs.</p>
<p>John wandered into the living room, taking in his surroundings. As with the rest of the village, the house was old and rustic. Wooden beams protruded from the ceiling and framed the doorways and arches between the rooms.</p>
<p>He walked over to the old stone mantelpiece and picked up a picture frame coated so thickly with dust that it was impossible to make out the image beneath. Using his sleeve John wiped the frame clean, revealing the photograph hidden beneath. A smiling young woman in her early twenties stood proudly in the frame. She was dressed in a formal military uniform: a slim fit brown jacket and tie, a beige shirt, and a black beret adorned with a badge bearing royal insignia. John looked at the photograph sadly for a moment, before carefully placing it back on the mantel.</p>
<p>He carried on, wandering through into the adjoining dining room. Plates with what was once food rested dormant on the placemats, glasses with white tide marks stood next to them. An acoustic guitar was leaning up against the wall in the corner of the room. John picked it up and dusted if off as he walked back into the living room and sat down on the settee. As he sat a thin cloud of dust rose a short distance into the air around him, then slowly lilted back down before coming once again to rest on the cushions.</p>
<p>He proceeded to pluck at the strings, turning the tuning pegs until the sound stared to ring true. He strummed a few chords and picked at the strings, as if to get a feel for the instrument again. Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground. The song echoed through the empty house. John started to hum along, his gruff voice spilling out and fading away into the empty street.</p>
<p>One of the strings snapped with a twang.<br>
"Oh well" he sighed and stopped playing. He got up, returned the guitar to its original resting place, and headed into the kitchen where he started to examine the contents of the cupboards.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oscar checked the use-by date on the can before carefully stacking it on top of the others in his rucksack. He pulled the cord to shut the rucksack. One of tin cans poked out slightly from the top. He paused, then walked over to the chair in the corner of the kitchen. He slumped down onto it, drained, his head in his hands. After a moment he tilted his head back and stared up at the ceiling, a few silent tears rolled down his cheeks. He exhaled, trying to regain his composure.</p>
<hr>
<p>The brick hurtled through the window with a resounding crash, shards of glass shattered to the floor. A mannequin toppled over, its wig flying off into the shop.<br>
"Whoo!" Ella cried out excited by the sight and sound of the broken window, thanks to Saoirse's throw.<br>
"Stay back while I open the door, okay?" Said Saoirse, as she stepped toward the hole. With another brick she knocked out the remaining pieces of glass from the top of the window frame before carefully stepping though. She unlocked the door and Ella ran into the shop.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Saoirse, "let's find your jacket."<br>
"Ah, can I try this?" Ella asked, tugging at a pair of jeans that hung on a rack.<br>
"No, we can come back later if you want. Now, let's get that jacket and carry on looking around for supplies, okay?"<br>
"Okay." Ella said, a little disgruntled.</p>
<hr>
<p>John arrived at the statue first, then Saoirse and Ella, and finally Oscar.<br>
"So," asked John, "what do we think? The buildings all seem in pretty good shape."<br>
"Plenty of food in the houses." Added Oscar, placing his rucksack on the ground, cans clanking.<br>
"I got a new jacket!" Ella said, beaming. The infectious smile spread around the group as she pirouetted to show it off, stumbling slightly into her fathers waiting arm.<br>
"Very pretty!" John remarked warmly.<br>
"Lots of shops, though not much food has survived." Said Saoirse, chuckling slightly at Ella's antics, "but by the sound of things the rest of the buildings should keep us pretty well stocked for some time."<br>
"So it's decided then." Said John, "any preference on where to stay?"<br>
"Those two look like a safe bet." Replied Oscar, pointing to two houses facing into the square.<br>
"Works for me" agreed Saoirse.<br>
"Good, for now let's have some lunch!" Said John, "Then I think we should have an explore and get acquainted with the village, we can move in first thing tomorrow."</p>
<p>After they had eaten, Ella and Oscar went out for a walk. Clear blue skies and a cool summer breeze accompanied them as they meandered their way around the picturesque, if a little run down, village.</p>
<p>As they reached the far end of the village they saw a partially collapsed house a short way ahead of them. The roof of the house had completely caved in, along with part of the upper floor. The neighbouring houses had also been damaged. It was as if something had taken a bite out of them. Debris scattered the road in front of the houses, and a ditch could be seen in the field beyond leading away from them.</p>
<p>Ella ran over to the scene of destruction to get a better look.<br>
"Careful," Oscar called after her, "don't go in the house, it's dangerous."</p>
<p>Ella turned to look down the ditch in the field and gasped.<br>
"Dad, look!" She shouted back excitedly, and proceeded to run along the ridge of the ditch out into the field. Oscar picked up the pace towards her.<br>
"Ella careful!" He called, slightly more sternly than usual, with concern in his voice.<br>
"Look!" Ella pointed down into the ditch, but Oscar couldn't see over the edge.</p>
<p>As he approached the beginning of the ditch at the edge of the road, Oscar could see dark, black, almost oil like water pooling at its bottom. The ditch got progressively deeper - growing into a ravine - until it stopped abruptly, not far from where Ella was stood, like an elongated teardrop. The water looked deep. The ground around the ravine was barren for more than a meter before weak shoots of grass had started to grow. A scar on an otherwise picturesque landscape.</p>
<p>A black metallic shape protruded out of the deepest part just below Ella, who was perched at the precipice, staring curiously in.<br>
"What is it?" She asked.<br>
"Get back from the edge, now!"<br>
Ella took a step back. Suddenly the ground beneath her feet gave way and she plummeted into the blackness.<br>
"ELLA!" Oscar yelled. He sprinted along the edge of the ravine before sliding down the side and into the water after her.</p>
<p>The freezing dark pressed against her skin. It burnt her eyes, forced its way into her mouth and nostrils. She began to panic and tried to breathe but the blackness choked her, forcing its way deeper, burning and freezing her insides. She thrashed about, trying to latch on to something, anything. But there was nothing. Nothing but icy black void.</p>
<p>Then something grabbed her wrist and began to pull. She could feel herself rising upwards. Then it moved and started to push her from under her arms, higher and higher. The void receded and warm air suddenly enveloped her face. Her eyes still burnt and could barely open, but she could see light. The blackness weighing down her throat spewed out of her mouth. She could hear urgent, panicked voices.</p>
<p>"I've got her, I've got her!" Somewhere through the cold and burning and the pain she heard John's voice. Another thing wrapped itself around her and raised her higher still. Then she was lying down, blades of grass brushing against her skin.</p>
<p>Saoirse quickly peeled the wet jacket off of the shivering girl, pulled her up onto her lap, and held her to her chest. She rubbed Ella's arms, frantically trying to warm her.</p>
<p>John helped Oscar out of the ditch who immediately clambered over to his daughter.<br>
"You're okay sweetie, you're okay" he said, his voice shaking, as he clasped Ella's face in his hands. Tears were pouring out of her bloodshot eyes as she coughed and spluttered. He wiped her face and head, trying in vain to clean away the black water; trying to remedy what had been done.</p>
<p>Ella clutched her chest, doubled over, and vomited.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>Oscar sat at the steering wheel. His back arched, arms tense, hands gripping it tightly, staring fixedly at the road ahead. Ella was sleeping peacefully on the backseat, Oscar's jacket draped over her and a seatbelt strapped in around her midriff.</p>
<p>The early morning sun was still rising. The long shadows cast by the few telegraph poles still standing stretched all the way across the overgrown, wild fields.</p>
<hr>
<p>"I'll go get the car," said Saoirse as she went to stand, "John, can you..?" She nodded to Ella, bent double in Oscars lap. Vomit speckled with flecks of black coated the girls trembling lips and chin.<br>
"'course" John nodded. Saoirse turned and headed off hurriedly back to the village square. John kneeled down beside the soaked pair, black tinted water still dripping from their clothes and skin.<br>
"Come on," he said, gently lifting the sobbing girl, "let's get her back to the farm."</p>
<p>John carried Ella off after Saoirse. For a moment Oscar stared blankly at the crumpled jacket with the sewn on butterflies, cast aside on the grass, stained and sopping with black water.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ella stirred in the backseat, letting out a groan. Oscar lent back, wordlessly putting his hand on her shoulder and rubbed gently with his thumb. A few errant strands of hair fell from the girls head and twisted their way down to the floor. The Land Rover sped on. Far off in the horizon the silhouetted outline of a city stared to grow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oscar finished tucking Ella into the sleeping bag on her bed, her hair still damp from the bath, her cheeks split by the stained streaks of tears, eyes still raw. The light in the room was fading with the setting sun.<br>
"Go." Said Saoirse, holding the girls hand. She looked up across the bed at Oscar, "Go get yourself cleaned up, I'll stay with her."</p>
<p>Only now did Oscar realise the state he was in. His clothes, tinted a darker shade by the inky water, clung to his gaunt frame. His hair was matted and greasy. His burn scars stung.</p>
<p>He headed into the bathroom. The bath was still full, translucent black clouds tainting the water. Without thinking and fully clothed, Oscar climbed in. He lay there for a moment, staring up at the disheveled ceiling. Slowly he let his head skin beneath the brine.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sun was high in the sky when Ella woke in the back of the Land Rover. She slowly pushed her self up rubbing her tired, sunken eyes. A mess of moulted hair marked the spot on the seat where her head had been resting. She adjusted the seatbelt allowing her to lean forward between the front seats and peer out though the windscreen.</p>
<p>They were driving through a long abandoned suburb. Overgrown gardens obscured the fronts of houses and spilt out onto the footpath and road beyond. The tops of cars, still parked in drives and along the curb, peered out from beneath the mess of thin, spindly flora.</p>
<p>The city loomed ahead of them. Many of the tallest buildings looked cragged; some even leaned against others, broken like a bone. Ella looked nervously on. She had never been this close before.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oscar lay on his bed staring up at the ceiling with hollowed eyes, a look of ambivalent stern anxiety on his face. Moonlight shone into the room, spilling across the bed. After a moment Oscar sat up on the side of the bed. He stared at the floor, his breathing slightly laboured.</p>
<p>Another moment passed before he rose and left the room. He walked the short way down the hall and quietly entered the next room. Ella was lying on her side in the bed, wrapped in her sleeping bag. Saoirse was curled up, asleep, in the armchair beside her.</p>
<p>As lightly as possible, Oscar made his way toward the bed. He crouched down beside his daughter and watched her as she slept. For a moment his sullen eyes softened, a gentle smile starting to show at the edges of his mouth. But the moment was brief, interrupted by Ella. The girl let out a quiet groan. Then another. She started to shiver as beads of cold sweat began forming on her face. Then, as soon as it had arrived, the distress passed.</p>
<p>Oscar gently dabbed the girls brow with his sleeve, lifting away the droplets of sweat. Her face appeared relaxed and peaceful, seemingly at odds with her state moments before. Then her eyes scrunched tight, her brow distorted, and her body tensed as another wave of anguish crashed over her.</p>
<p>Again it passed, again Oscar dabbed her brow. Quietly he stood and looked down at Ella filled with worry and determination. He slowly backed his way to the door, struggling to tear his eyes away from her, before finally turning and leaving the room.</p>
<p>He headed out into the hall and silently made his way down the stairs, treading lightly, the stairs creaking softly beneath his feet. In the kitchen he found dark sheets of metal, stained darker still by the black water, strewn across the table. Some of the pieces had numbers stamped into them, others had bold, white lettering on them, partially worn away. One piece had a hand-written message on it, the ink barely visible. "With Love fr-" the final words melted away along a tide mark of dark scum.</p>
<p>A sudden snore startled Oscar. He looked up to see John asleep in the armchair across the way in the living room. It was clear the old man had been busy in their absence. As his eyes drifted back to the table, light from the moon glinted off the clean inside of one of the panels. Oscar walked around the table to get a better look and saw on it a collection of frightening looking warning symbols in yellow triangles.</p>
<p>He grabbed the map with all the concentric circles on it from the far end of the table and rushed back up the stairs.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Are we going in there?" Ella asked, her voice weak, as she looked on at the city. Her skin, Oscar noticed as he glanced back at her in the rear view mirror, looked ghostly pale.<br>
"No, it isn't safe in there. We're headed to a hospital, somewhere we can find something to make you feel better."<br>
Ella carried on staring out of the window, Oscar wasn't sure if she had heard what he said.</p>
<p>As the city loomed ever larger so too did the plant life recede. The world around them became more desolate, more barren. The buildings grew bigger and the road was gradually becoming blocked by cars. Oscar was having to swerve around them with increasing frequency.<br>
"Daddy, I don't feel good." Said Ella, her arms around her chest, eyes barely open, head swaying. She coughed and heaved horsely for a moment before what little was left in her stomach finally expelled itself through her mouth. She collapsed back onto the seat.</p>
<p>"Ella!" Cried Oscar, intense fear in his voice. He stopped the car, jumped out, and pulled open the rear door to get to her. She let out a groan and tried to move, but could barely lift her hand. Vomit speckled the back of the seats in front, a small drip still clinging to her chin.<br>
"Easy, it's okay, we're almost there. Not far now." Oscar said, as reassuringly as he could, although his voice trembled. He quickly unbuckled the seatbelt before carefully lifting the small, pallid girl out of the car, carrying her in his arms.<br>
"You'll be okay sweetie, you'll be okay."</p>
<p>He hurriedly made his way off the road and along the footpath. The yellow box around his neck started to crackle, like the sound that a toy with an electric buzzer would make after an inquisitive child accidentally dunks it in water.</p>
<p>Oscar turned and made his way down a wide alley between two tall wooden fences. Some life was, just about, surviving in the alley. A few weeds poked their way up through the gravelly ground that crunched beneath Oscars feet. Some ivy still clung to the fences on either side, but it was thinning and wilted, its colour closer to grey than green.</p>
<p>To Ella it was like a jungle. Vibrant greens surrounded her on either side and from below. The sky was bright and blue, almost overwhelming her senses. She could see sparklingly lights dancing around her, like fireflies flitting to and fro. She felt warm.</p>
<p>Ahead of them, to Oscars great relief, could be seen the front of the hospital. But that relief was short lived. As they reached the end of the alleyway Ella convulsed, clutching at her chest. Her eyes were watering. Oscar carefully laid her down on a stretch of dirt in which a few brave spouts of grass were growing, that bordered between the road and footpath they had just come out on.</p>
<p>"I'm coming right back, okay?" He said, putting a hand to her brow. It was burning. Oscar turned and ran across the road toward the hospital. The glass in the automatic doors had been broken years before, the shards scattered all over the floor. He ignored it can carried on through. A shard, sticking down from the top of the door, caught on his head just above his hairline. Oscar stumbled as he clasped a hand to his head, but the blood was already flowing. He did his best to ignore it and carried on.</p>
<p>He looked around frantically, but couldn't see what he was looking for. He picked the nearest corridor and ran down it. It was mostly clear, aside from a couple of stretchers pushed up against the walls. Someone's handbag was sitting, untouched, next to a row of chairs lined up against one of the walls. He read the signs as he ran down the corridor: toilets, a restaurant, a couple of examination rooms. At the end of the corridor was a stairwell. Oscar burst through the doors and ran up the stairs.</p>
<p>He pushed his way through two sets of double doors on the first floor and found himself in a ward full of beds. The smell hit him like a sledge hammer as the stagnant air was sucked past him, through the open doors. Bodies lay decomposed in the beds, some still attached to sensors and IV drips. One was on the floor. It looked as though whoever it was had tried to crawl. Oscar stepped over the corpse as he made his way though and out of the ward, a hand covering his mouth.</p>
<p>The smell followed him as he stepped out into another corridor. Again he ran down it, checking the signs as he went, until he saw it. The sign for the pharmacy. He rounded a corner and ran on a short way before finally reaching it. He ran through the waiting area and hopped over the counter, knocking pens and half completed prescriptions on to the floor as he did so. Then, all of a sudden, he was struck with panic. He didn't know what to take.</p>
<p>He ran though to the back, hoping that the act of doing something would help, but it only compounded his panic as he was confronted with rows upon rows of shelves stocked with all kinds of medicines. Oscar started working his way down the rows, scanning the labels of the packets as he did so.</p>
<p>Having finished the first row, he moved on to the second. Then he faltered. He had caught something, a word. There it was. Iodine. Oscar grabbed the few remaining boxes and ran, full pelt, out of the pharmacy. Back along the corridor, back through the ward - almost tripping over the remains on the floor, back down the stairs, along the ground floor, and out of the hospital.</p>
<p>Oscar ran out across the road. His pace slowed. He knew it before he even got close.</p>
<p>As he reached her he fell to his knees.</p></article></div></div><script>

Hailing from a small village that skirts the northern edge of the Forest of Tethir and a stones throw from the great city of Murann, Zamarin spent much of his youth exploring in those wild, unspoilt woods.

As he got older, the draw of the Sailors' City became too enticing and so he left the village in search of new adventures (and, let's be fair, it was a small village — the gene pool was getting dangerously close to… well, shall we say… consolidation).

Murann was an overwhelming smorgasbord of cultures and sensations. Being a coastal trade city, it was both rest stop and home to an innumerable number of races and creeds from all the far flung corners of Toril.

Seeing the ships and the people, hearing the tales of merchants, sailors, whalers, missionaries, or whom ever else happened to be within earshot, Zamarin became enamoured with the sense of freedom and discovery that the open ocean could provide; the smell and taste of the sea an ever present siren.

So he started his life as a sailor, first signing on with the crew of the Batavia, a merchant ship of Muranni build and registry, that travelled between the city and various ports on the far-flung continent of Maztica.

After a time — and a fair few transoceanic trips — Zamarin parted from the Batavia and started travelling all across the inhabited lands of Toril, paying his passage working as a ship-hand and navigator for any who would take him.

While not a deeply pious half-elf, it was not unheard of for Zamarin to pray to Selûne for strength, guidance, or an umbrella, when the seas were particularly tumultuous.

The wind whipped at his cloak has he stood on the deck of the ship, looking out over the choppy water to the jagged island of Jotunspine rising in the distance. The journey had been an arduous one, but Zaramin still managed to cut a striking silhouette as the ship neared port.

Once docked, Zamarin thanked the ships captain for his passage. The captain guffawed, “No, it is me who should be thanking you! Without your truly exceptional navigational skills, we might never have made it!”
Ever gracious, Zamarin just smiled and said, “It was nothing, really.”

With that he strode off the ship and down the dock, headed for the warm comfort of the nicest inn on the island. Even a hardy ranger the likes of he can enjoy the finer things in life!

The next morning, well fed and rested, our hero made his way to the Keep of the Whitehand clan to make his presence known to the Jarl. The previous night the inn-keep had mentioned that the Jarl’s ward had gone missing, and all the search parties had come up empty. Instantly Zamarin sensed a chance to earn some coin — and to help save a weak and innocent child, of course.

Befitting his reputation, Zamarin was ushered quickly into the foyer of the Keep by a stooped, but still sturdy looking, old man missing an eye and a hand, where he was asked to wait a moment while the Jarl prepared to meet him.

A fellow half-elf, a dwarf, and a tiefling, _of all things_, were already waiting in the foyer. _The Jarl must be desperate_, Zamarin thought, _good thing he’s got me now, assuming the coin is right, of course_. A wise half-elf would never do something he was so skilled at for free.

The conversation was stifled at first, as they waited there in the foyer. _Clearly they feel nervous in my humble presence_. Brief introductions were made; Sola Vagari the fellow half-elf, Dain the dwarf, and Vadania Fenriz the tiefling.

After a time the old man returned and they were lead in to the great hall. A large table, flanked by thirty or so clansmen, stood in the centre of the room. At the far end sat the Jarl. All were eating, drinking, and talking as the group entered. Not a single one looked up, much to our hero’s chagrin, although he appreciated being in a place where not everyone knew his name (and he was sure they’d soon come to learn it).

The Jarl bade them welcome as they approached, and quickly got to conveying the details of his wards disappearance.
“She’s been obsessed with these myths of this damn Keep!” He said. “Spending all her time in the library reading this and then that about the legend of Icegate! The place doesn’t even exist, I’ve told her as much. And now I think she’s got it in her head that she can find the blasted thing!”
